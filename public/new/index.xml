      <description>This is about Article 13 and Why it is actually great for YouTube as a company but will cause more censorship across the European Union.

There is a specific provision in Article 13 that I think Google will leverage and completely annihilate the competition.</description>

      <description>This walks you through what your htaccess should look like in a WordPress Installation. I am a minimalist and believe you shouldn’t be using a ton of plugins that slow down your install when most of what you are looking to accomplish can be achieved with this file. Therefore, this htaccess will contain bad bot blocker, security optimizations, force https, and a variety of other optimizations. This will save you from installing about 5-10 plugins that would slow down your website.</description>

      <description>The Snipping Tool is being removed by Microsoft in October 2018 Update 1809 and I am not happy! This tool is one of the best tools Microsoft has ever created, so why? Well, they want you to use the Snip and Sketch App from the Microsoft Store. Spoiler: It sucks.
Greenshot the best Snipping Tool Replacement So what should you use? Greenshot. Its freeware and it just works. Not bulky with a toolbar, but adds a tray icon, which you don’t have to use.</description>

      <description>This video goes over how to stake EOS for CPU, RAM, and bandwidth. It shows real-world examples of staking and unstaking EOS when utilizing the EOS dApps.
Staking Basics You can stake and unstake from many dApps, but my preferred method is using the EOS Toolkit and finalizing my amounts in there. Personally, I recommend 8 KB for RAM, 15 EOS for CPU, and .1 EOS for Net as this will give you the ability to play and use pretty much any decentralized app out right now.</description>

      <description>Chrome started rolling out update 69 at the beginning of this month (September 2018) causing a missing www in the address bar. There are two things this update did that you need to be aware of.
Google Chrome Update 69 Changes  Show trivial sub-domains (missing www in the address bar)  Fix: Type this in your address bar: chrome://flags/#omnibox-ui-hide-steady-state-url-scheme-and-subdomains Set to DISABLED   Chrome now defaults to SSL / HTTPS for all websites  So I didn’t realize this happened and launched a new ubuntu web server to find it unreachable with apache installed.</description>

Mining Pool Hub is one of the best out there with the auto exchange feature and frequent payouts. On the other hand, the website itself is very cumbersome and not user-friendly with infrequent updates. Consequently, use the following script for viewing outside of the browser, however, if you want a browser-based monitor I recommend miningpoolhubstats.</description>

      <description>This How-To shows you how to get rid of Amazon Fire Launcher without root access. Amazon Fire 5.3.3 OS can’t be downgraded or rooted, and since the Fire tablet line auto-updates, this leads many folks with the horrible experience of using the Fire OS with their gimped store/subscriptions.
The process to use Google Services and Googles Store instead is a bit involved but entirely doable on the Fire Tablets without having to root it.</description>

      <description>Here is a custom script that reports the nvidia-smi temperature of the Nvidia cards in your system using NRPE. Conversely, NRPE performs much better than NCPA and my protocol of choice.
*Note: Install NRPE to your Linux box first, and create this file (gpu_temp.sh) in your /usr/lib/nagios/plugins directory for Nagios Core 4+
Nagios NRPE Query Command check_nrpe!gpu_temp.sh
This will only query the first GPU that is found via nvidia-smi CLI command.</description>

      <description>Use the following command to verify you have all your config and command files correct when troubleshooting Nagios core installation. This will give you a readout of any configuration errors, thus giving you the ability to fix it on the fly.
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
I’d recommend making an alias in your .bashrc so you can just type:testnag
Here is an example of the alias I use
alias testnag=&#39;/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg&#39;</description>

      <description>Perform the following steps to solve the Spooler subsystem app high CPU usage. I recently updated a computer to Windows 10 and found that the spooler service was using a lot of resources.
The Solution  Open up command prompt as administrator and type the following  net stop spooler&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; del /Q /F /S &amp;quot;%systemroot%\System32\Spool\Printers\*.*&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; net start spooler&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Conclusion Now check task manager again and verify the Spooler subsystem app is now at 0% usage.</description>

Most businesses want to move to the “cloud” but have no idea what that means. If you’re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you’re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract.</description>

HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component.
After finding a Knowledge-base article from Microsoft, I discovered Exchange 2007 SP1 doesn’t support installation on a server with more than 24 processors but is perfectly fine updating and running on a server with more than 24 processors.</description>

      <description>This post goes over setting the Anti-Spam SCL in Microsoft Exchange. I typically recommend leaving the Delete and Reject settings alone, but change the Move Message to Junk if the user is reporting a high amount of spam making it to his inbox. This is done with the command below SCLJunkThreshold.
SCL (Spam Confidence Level) determines what to do with a message
Default Exchange Values 9 = Delete Message with no NDR&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 7= Reject Message with NDR&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 5= Move Message to Junk Mail in Mailbox</description>

      <description>Using Windows Refresh PC now solves the common problem, that PCs get infected with viruses and require you to either reload it from the disc or recovery partition. Sometimes people lost the disc, re-partitioned their drives, or simply had their hard drive fail. This leads to installing windows from scratch and hunting down all your drivers.
That is all changing in Windows 8, they are including a “Refresh” option and a “Remove everything and Re-install Windows” option.</description>

      <description>If you had the misfortune of installing Exchange on Primary Domain Controller you will experience some pain when doing a reboot. Typically it will take 10-15 minutes before it restarts and up to 30 minutes to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Consequently, what is really happening in the background is the IS service is being terminated incorrectly on shutdown and the store is left in a “DIRTY” shutdown state. This is very bad on several levels and can cause the Store to corrupt and not start at all, which can be catastrophic.</description>

      <description>There is an application called ForceBindIP that allows you to bind certain applications to network connections. It doesn’t work for all applications, but most of them. It is also a bit glitchy in Vista and 7.
Download ForceBindIP
Write down your IP Addresses. I use a wired and wireless connection.
 -Run -&amp;gt; cmd
  -ipconfig
 Modify your Application shortcut’s target window
 -Add forcebindip ipaddress in front of “C:applicationpathexecutable.</description>

      <description>There is a couple different methods to finding the version of your exchange server.
File System %Program Files%MicrosoftExchange Serverbin folder (different for 2003) and right click store.exe -&amp;gt; Detail Tab -&amp;gt; Version
——-OR——–
Exchange Management Console Go to Server Configuration -&amp;gt; Hub Transport -&amp;gt; Look at Version column (Exchange 2007)
——-OR——–
Exchange Management Shell type get-exchangeserver
Write down the Version number and find it on this list. It will provide you with the proper service pack and date of exchange server.</description>

      <description>I use both SQL Express 2005 on a server and SQL 2008 on another server. The following script is nice to manually grow a file. By default, SQL auto-grows database files by 10% when it runs low on space. In most cases this is fine, but I’m a perfectionist and hate receiving errors about low DB Space in my SCE (System Center Essentials) console.

      <description>I will walk through the various backup solutions out there for businesses. Most of the big names in the backup world are very good at backups, however they must be used properly. If using Windows Server 2003, I’d recommend Acronis True Image for any file systems and NTbackup for the exchange backup or other servers. If using Windows Server 2008, I’d recommend Acronis True Image for any servers, and Acronis® Recovery™ for Microsoft Exchange.</description>

      <description>Many small and medium businesses do not have any email redundancy, and in today’s IT environment that is unacceptable. There is 3 widely used methods for never missing or having downtime for email. Depending on the size of your business there are some that make more sense than others.

      <description>Exchange Management Shell is the core of Microsoft Exchange. The GUI was an after thought, especially in Exchange 2007. Here are some useful commands that I use often.
Export Company to PSTs
 Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit SBSUsers | Export-Mailbox -PSTFolderPath C:pathtosave -BadItemLimit 10000 -ExcludeFolders “Junk E-Mail”,”Deleted Items” -StartDate “01/01/2009 00:01:00”
 This is useful for moving an entire exchange store into PST format. This can be used for Exchange to External mail system migrations, or just to have a backup to access mailboxes at that point in time.</description>

      <guid>/eseutil-proper-usage-and-when-to-use-it/</guid>
      <description>ESEUTIL is a utility to repair, check, and defrag Microsoft exchange stores. Before using ESEUTIL you must unmount your exchange store and be prepared to have downtime.
ESEUTIL /d “C:ExchangeStorePathstore.edb” (Defrag)
Note: I’d rarely recommend using this defrag option, but in certain instances when exchange stores are merged or drastically changed it can be beneficial. This is an OFFLINE defrag and should not be used for frequent maintenance. I’ve seen people make big mistakes by pulling a perfectly good exchange store offline to try and squeeze an extra 10 GB out of it.</description>
