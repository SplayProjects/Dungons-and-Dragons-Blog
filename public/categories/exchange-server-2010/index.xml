      <description>This post goes over how to grant full access to all public folders for a user in Microsoft Exchange. I recently was migrating all public folders from an Exchange 2010 to Office 365 Environment and didn’t have access to some of the folders. Consequently, this solution saved me a lot of time from doing it through a GUI.
Command Enter the following in Exchange Management Shell:
Get-PublicFolder –Identity &amp;quot;\Root Folder Name&amp;quot; -Recurse | Add-PublicFolderAdministrativePermission -User &amp;quot;ctitus&amp;quot; -AccessRights AllExtendedRights</description>

      <description>This post goes over setting the Anti-Spam SCL in Microsoft Exchange. I typically recommend leaving the Delete and Reject settings alone, but change the Move Message to Junk if the user is reporting a high amount of spam making it to his inbox. This is done with the command below SCLJunkThreshold.
SCL (Spam Confidence Level) determines what to do with a message
Default Exchange Values 9 = Delete Message with no NDR&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 7= Reject Message with NDR&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 5= Move Message to Junk Mail in Mailbox</description>
