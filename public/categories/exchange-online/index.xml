      <description>This shows you how to exclude shared mailboxes from a Dynamic Distribution Group in Exchange Online. We will be using Powershell to make sure your shared mailboxes don’t get spam in them.
 Commands Connect to O365 in PS: $UserCredential = Get-Credential&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Import-PSSession $Session
Exclude Shared Mailboxes with this filter command: set-DynamicDistributionGroup -Name &amp;quot;all@yourcompany.com&amp;quot; -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq &#39;UserMailbox&#39;) -and -not (RecipientTypeDetailsValue -eq &#39;SharedMailbox&#39;))}</description>

      <description>This article teaches you how to prevent autodiscover from happening on Exchange Server. This is important on an Office 365 migration when you still need to keep your local exchange server from resolving.
Commands First change your local DNS
autodiscover.yourdomain.com cname autodiscover.office365.com
(Option 1)Next, you need to disable SCP site-wide. I did this performing a GPO Registry edit.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Outlook\AutoDiscover&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Notex.0 in the above registry path corresponds to the Outlook version (16.</description>

      <title>Grant Full Access to all Public Folders for a user in Exchange</title>

      <description>This post goes over how to grant full access to all public folders for a user in Microsoft Exchange. I recently was migrating all public folders from an Exchange 2010 to Office 365 Environment and didn’t have access to some of the folders. Consequently, this solution saved me a lot of time from doing it through a GUI.
Command Enter the following in Exchange Management Shell:
Get-PublicFolder –Identity &amp;quot;\Root Folder Name&amp;quot; -Recurse | Add-PublicFolderAdministrativePermission -User &amp;quot;ctitus&amp;quot; -AccessRights AllExtendedRights</description>

      <description>This article goes over Exchange Online Archive Requirements and the headache of licensing for it. I recently completed a staged migration from exchange 2007 to exchange online. If you have any users over 50 GB you need the exchange online archive. Upload all your archive files using Azure copy (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/use-network-upload-to-import-pst-files for instructions). Afterward, make sure to check https://outlook.office365.com/owa/ to verify the archive emails. You may notice that their outlook doesn’t show the archive.</description>
