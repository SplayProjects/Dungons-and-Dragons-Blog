It teaches you the proper way to setup your system to work long term in the macOS ecosystem.\nOpenCore Wiki Source for the content in this post is from https://dortania.github.io/.\nThis knowledge base is fantastic for any information I glaze over or troubleshooting that isn\u0026rsquo;t covered. It is much more indepth than this article, but can be confusing in parts. This article is meant to get you acquainted with OpenCore and fill in any missing gaps.\nWhy I Use OpenCore? I use opencore for compatibility and everything can be setup in a non macOS environment. It also injects drivers support (kext) differently than past methods and is far more stable.\nThis also means updates are far less likely to break your system and boot times are just as fast as a regular mac, if not faster.\nI also find a larger amount of hardware is supported and the finished product is all contained neatly in an EFI partition.\nHardware Compatibility Even with OpenCore supporting a lot more hardware there is still some hardware that simply will not work on macOS no matter what you do. Here is a definitive guide https://dortania.github.io/Anti-Hackintosh-Buyers-Guide/.\nThe TLDR of that guide is the last two generations of nVidia Graphics Cards and future nVidia Cards are not compatible, and even old nVidia cards will not work past High Sierra (10.13.x). Also, almost every Intel Wireless card will not function properly or work at all. So buying a replacement is needed for laptops.\nAMD CPUs can technically work, but will require more tinkering and are more difficult than the Intel counterparts.\nFiles and Projects you need to download and what they do Here is a list of all the files and GitHub projects that are used for OpenCore.\n OpenCore GitHub (Base Project) - https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases All Drivers, Kexts, and SSDTs - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/ktext.html GitMacOS GitHub (Download Official Apple PKGs) - https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS ProperTree (config.plist editing) - https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree SSDTTime (DSDT Dump and SSDT creation) - https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime GenSMBIOS (Generate Serial and UUID) - https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS  Checklist for https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide  Check Hardware Compatibility - Document all device IDs and firmware Download All Projects and Files Boot Into Linux and do a DSDT dump followed by creating SSDT files for your computer (DO NOT USE PREBUILT!) Delete all files that your system doesn\u0026rsquo;t need Put all Your Drivers in the EFI Folder Note: I swapped AppleHDA for VoodooHDA on an old sound card. Do NOT just put every kext you find in one folder. Build config.plist and configure EVERY SINGLE Fold in the config.plist file to your computers specifications Boot to Installer! Note: This will probably fail the first couple times, it is very important to follow the config.plist guide and full auditing enabled  I live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

Feel free to edit the .vimrc to your needs.\nLightLine This plugin adds a nice look to the bottom part of vim and adding a colored line that is now displayed and changes when VIM enters different modes.\nOneDark This is a theme for VIM that adds a greater contrast and dark theme to vim. This makes text and everything inside easier to read.\nFZF (Fuzzy Search) This adds greater functionality to search that allows you to search for partial matches easier. See full syntax here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage\nGoYo This plugin removes all the numbers and formatting and makes it easier when writing documents in VIM. From Normal Mode - I made the hotkey Ctrl+\\ to enter this special format.\nUndoTree UndoTree is an amazing plugin that makes it easy to see everything you have done in your session. Simply press F5 from Normal mode and you will see the entire all your recent changes and undo them.\nNerdTree NerdTree is a file management plugin. This hotkey is Ctrl+o and opens up a file tree on the left side for you switch files\nVimWiki VimWiki adds syntax formatting for markdown and is a fantastic plugin to have if you many markdown files.\nConclusion There is still a ton of other edits I need to make to this VIM and will be a work in progress for many years. Everyday I learn something new and powerful with VIM and if you can think about what you want, I am sure VIM will be able to accommodate that. Future additions that I am looking at is SpellCheck, VIM Tabs, and general improvements to the .vimrc file. My vimrc file currently has a lot of the most common tweaks, longer history, sorting, file numbering, and removal of auto comment formatting, However there is still a of things to improve.

With that said we will be going over the basic structure of BTRFS and the things you should and should not do.\nCreating a BTRFS Filesystem Create the file system on an empty btrfs partition\n mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1\nNote: You will need to mount this file system after\n Now we need to make a subvolume before we add data to the device\n btrfs subvolume create /mnt/sda1 /mnt/sda1 is the mount point!\n After this is complete you can now write data to your BTRFS volume and use all it capabilities.\nBasic BTRFS Layout\nNote: Top Level 5 is root and isn\u0026rsquo;t a btrfs subvolume that can do snapshots and other btrfs features and therefore should not be mounted\ntoplevel root level 5 +-- root\\@ level 256 (subvolume root mounted at / id varies) +-- root\\.snapshots level 256 (typical snapshot subvolume) Basic Commands  Disk free\nsudo btrfs fi show   Output:\n  Disk Usage\nsudo btrfs fi du / Note: you can make / any other mount point Scrub SubVolume Recommended running every week!\nsudo btrfs scrub start / Balance Subvolume for Performance\nsudo btrfs balance start -musage=50 -dusage=50 /\nNote: Use the musgae and dusage filters to only balance used blocks above 50 percent utilization\nsudo btrfs balance cancel / Stops running balance List Subvolumes based on mountpoint\nsudo btrfs subv list /home   Output:\n  Mount Subvolume\nsudo mount -o subvolid=267 /dev/sda1 /media/games\nOR add this to /etc/fstab\nUUID=IDGOESHERE /media/games rw,exec,subvolid=267 0 0  Snapshots Snapshots are one of the best things about BTRFS and I absolutely love them. They are incredible powerful and beneficial.\nSo Lets run through some scenarios when you use Snapshots.\nCreate Snapshot  sudo btrfs subv snapshop /home /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13\n Using this you can revert the snapshop by simply editing the /etc/fstab and changing the subvol=2020-01-13 or the corresponding subvolid you get from sudo btrfs subv list /home\nRestore Snapshot Restore Snapshop after reboot and successful rollback\n sudo btrfs subv delete /home\nsudo btrfs subv snapshot /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13 /home\n Now simply restore your fstab and reboot to be back on the /home subvolume.\nThe reason to do it using this method is to verify the data first. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out you can simply change the /etc/fstab back and you will be back to where you started.\nMultiple disks and RAID Oh boy, here we go. This is such a badly misunderstood subject and if you aren\u0026rsquo;t careful you will be causing more problems than you are looking to solve. So with that let\u0026rsquo;s get into RAID. I will NOT be cover RAID 5 as it is unstable and SHOULD NOT BE USED!\nMust know commands for multiple disks:\n Add Disks before creating subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nAdd Disk to existing subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sdb1 /home\nDelete Disk from subvolume: sudo btrfs device delete /dev/sdb1 /home\n Creating the RAID File System:\n RAID 1: sudo btrfs -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nRAID 10: sudo btrfs -m raid10 -d raid10 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n Convert to to RAID 1 after adding disk to existing subvolume\n btrfs balance start -mconvert=raid1 -dconvert=raid1 /home\n I could put RAID 0 here\u0026hellip; but honestly you should just use EXT4 or XFS if you are looking for performance.

Note: My Debian system had an old version of HUGO 0.40 and I had to update before the theme worked.\nChanging Theme Widgets Social Widget I first started to change the social widget by adding YouTube and Twitch from the following file siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/social.html.\nThe Most challengeing Part of this was the SVG files used by mainroad. However, once I figured out the SVG format can be edited in a simple text editor and I mirrored the size and types from the existing SVG files they showed up.\nHere are the Edits I made to social.html:\n{{- with .Site.Params.widgets.social.twitch }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget-social__item widget__item\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026quot;widget-social__link widget__link btn\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitch\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;https://twitch.tv/{{ . }}\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ partial \u0026quot;svg/twitch.svg\u0026quot; (dict \u0026quot;class\u0026quot; \u0026quot;widget-social__link-icon\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Twitch Live Streams\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} Basically after getting the SVG setup and putting the twitch.svg and youtube.svg in this path siteroot/mainroad/layouts/partials/svg I was able to get the Social widget exactly how I wanted.\nTags Widget Next up was fixing the tags on the sidebar. They were blocky and quite ugly, where I wanted a traditional tag cloud that you see on many other sites to help users navigate your content. So I began looking at other projects that had the proper code. I found the following code snippit:\n{{ if not (eq (len $.Site.Taxonomies.tags) 0) }} {{ $fontUnit := \u0026quot;rem\u0026quot; }} {{ $largestFontSize := 2.0 }} {{ $largestFontSize := 2.5 }} {{ $smallestFontSize := 1.0 }} {{ $fontSpread := sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize }} {{ $max := add (len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount 0).Pages) 1 }} {{ $min := len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount.Reverse 0).Pages }} {{ $spread := sub $max $min }} {{ $fontStep := div $fontSpread $spread }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget-taglist widget\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4 class=\u0026quot;widget__title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ T \u0026quot;tags_title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget__content\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;tag-cloud\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;padding: 5px 15px\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ range $name, $taxonomy := $.Site.Taxonomies.tags }} {{ $currentTagCount := len $taxonomy.Pages }} {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $currentTagCount $min) $fontStep) ) }} {{ $count := len $taxonomy.Pages }} {{ $weigth := div (sub (math.Log $count) (math.Log $min)) (sub (math.Log $max) (math.Log $min)) }} {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize) $weigth) ) }} \u0026lt;!--Current font size: {{$currentFontSize}}--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ \u0026quot;/tags/\u0026quot; | relLangURL }}{{ $name | urlize }}\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;font-size:{{$currentFontSize}}{{$fontUnit}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ $name }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} After replacing siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/taglist.html with the following code. The tag cloud was complete.\nHeader/Footer Modification Replacing the Header and footer was extremely easy as it is just plain HTML. The files are located in siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/header.html or footer.html. You can leave the stock, but I wanted to add a privacy policy and terms of service to be compliant.\nTable of Contents Changes I replaced the title \u0026ldquo;PAGE CONTENTS\u0026rdquo; with share buttons using a share-buttons.html I created. This could all be done in the post-toc.html file, but I wanted to keep it modular and not make too many edits to the theme. Here were my changes:\nsiteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/post-toc.html\n{{ if .Param \u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;post__toc toc\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;toc__title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ partial \u0026quot;share-buttons.html\u0026quot;

\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Adding AdSense and Custom Scripts to All Pages To add specific scripts to all pages, such as AdSense, you will need to modify siteroot/themes/mainroad/_defaults/baseof.html. I added the following before the \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; of this file to populate AdSense. You could put Analytics in here as well, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t needed since mainroad theme has the option in config.toml. Here are my modifications:\nbaseof.html\n{{- if not .Site.IsServer }} {{ template \u0026quot;_internal/google_analytics_async.html\u0026quot; . }} {{ partial \u0026quot;adsense-auto.html\u0026quot; . }} {{- end }} \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; siteroot/layouts/partials/adsense-auto.html - NEW FILE\n\u0026lt;script data-ad-client=\u0026quot;ca-pub-000000000000000\u0026quot; async src=\u0026quot;https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; _Note: Make sure to use your ca-pub-IDGOESHERE\nConfiguration of config.toml In your siteroot you will see this file that you will need to configure. Most users will simply edit this and away they go. Everything in this file worked pretty darn well. There was a couple spots that tripped me up which I will go over now.\nBaseURL Make sure you fill this out completely. I messed up the automated sitemap.xml because I simply put / instead of my entire address. This is what I have in the file now: baseURL = \u0026quot;https://www.christitus.com/\u0026quot;\nAnalytics, Social, and Title/Description All of these options worked perfectly and I had no issues.\nMenu The last problem I had was the menu at the top of my theme. I soon learned there was a syntax to the config.toml file that I missed. I simply added this to the bottom and changed the weight to sort the menu properly. Here is that code snippit:\n[menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; pre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-heart'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; weight = -110 [[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Donate\u0026quot; post = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; pre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-road'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;https://www.patreon.com/christitustech\u0026quot; weight = -105 [[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Remote Support\u0026quot; post = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; pre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-road'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;https://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerQS.exe\u0026quot; weight = -100 Note: I added external site links and a proper home button\nTemplates to Optimze My Workflow This is where HUGO really shines and saves me a TON of time compared to WordPress and the like.

This will teach you how to modify lightdm to choose a default desktop environment, theme, autologin, and even a VNC connection.\nReference Articles:\nUbuntu Wiki\nArch Wiki\nDebian Wiki\nInstallation For Debian based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo apt install lightdm\nFor Arch based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo pacman -S lightdm\nActivating LightDM on startup Before you can enable the lightdm service you will need to disable your current display manager.\nFor disabling SDDM (KDE Systems) type sudo systemctl disable sddm\nFor disabling GDM (Gnome Systems) type sudo systemctl disable gdm\nConfiguration Start out with opening up your /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and this is where most of the modifications will take place.\nI will go over the 4 sections in the configuration that most will want to change or modify.\nChanging the Theme lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*] #type=local #pam-service=lightdm #pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin #pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter #xserver-command=X #xmir-command=Xmir #xserver-config= #xserver-layout= #xserver-allow-tcp=false #xserver-share=true #xserver-hostname= #xserver-display-number= #xdmcp-manager= #xdmcp-port=177 #xdmcp-key= greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter ### CHANGE THIS #greeter-hide-users=false #greeter-allow-guest=true #greeter-show-manual-login=false #greeter-show-remote-login=true Install what ever theme you want, this is called a greeter in lightdm, and then change the line above. After the changes are made you can either reboot or type sudo systemctl restart lightdm Please Note: This will log you out\nChanging the Default Desktop Environment lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*] #type=local #pam-service=lightdm #pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin #pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter #xserver-command=X #xmir-command=Xmir #xserver-config= #xserver-layout= #xserver-allow-tcp=false #xserver-share=true #xserver-hostname= #xserver-display-number= #xdmcp-manager= #xdmcp-port=177 #xdmcp-key= greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter #greeter-hide-users=false #greeter-allow-guest=true #greeter-show-manual-login=false #greeter-show-remote-login=true user-session=default ################ CHANGE THIS #allow-user-switching=true #allow-guest=true #guest-session= To specify a specific desktop environment you need to change the user-session line to be your desktop environment. For example I use the awesome window manager for mine and I put user-session=awesome\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the name, the desktop environment list can be found with listing .desktop file from /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nFor complete listing of user sessions type: ls /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nAutoLogin with LightDM Change the following part of the file to autologin. Note: This does pose a security risk and should never be done in a business\nlightdm.conf Under [Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false autologin-user=username autologin-user-timeout=0 autologin-in-background=false #autologin-session= I generally uncomment the following lines above and just change this line autologin-user=username and then it will autologin that user on the next reboot. Note: You can use the autologin-guest instead of user to have it autologin as a guest account.\nVNC Connection At the buttom of the lightdm.conf file you will see VNC connection information. This information uses the tigervnc package and also is done using secure channel. This means you must establish a SSH connection with a portforward before you can connect to VNC. Example: ssh 192.168.69.10 -L 9901:localhost:5901 This establishes ssh and port forwards your local port 9901 to 5901 of the remote machine. Then you could launch VNC viewer with vncviewer localhost:9901. Even though this says localhost it is forwarding the request through SSH to the remote machine.\nNow with that framework lets look at the conf file:\n# # VNC Server configuration # # enabled = True if VNC connections should be allowed # command = Command to run Xvnc server with # port = TCP/IP port to listen for connections on # listen-address = Host/address to listen for VNC connections (use all addresses if not present) # width = Width of display to use # height = Height of display to use # depth = Color depth of display to use # [VNCServer] #enabled=false #command=Xvnc #port=5900 #listen-address= #width=1024 #height=768 #depth=8 The main things to change here are enabled=true width - height - depth and then you are off. My typical defaults would look like the following:\n[VNCServer] enabled=true command=Xvnc port=5900 #listen-address= width=1920 height=1080 depth=16 Video Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

However, you can do all the same tweaks by simply going through settings and doing all these manually. That said, I recommend using O\u0026amp;O Shutup10 for optimal tweaks and privacy.

I will go over performing this in a Debian-based system and an Arch-based system. Please note that the arch based system requires you to build the kernel yourself and will take much longer.\nCustom kernels in Linux are based on the Zen project and have some workstation/desktop optimizations. They are NOT meant for server installations. These are meant for those using Linux Desktop and utilizing it for Gaming, Production, etc. and overall I don’t recommend using these. However, if you like to tinker and squeeze every bit of performance out of your kernel than you can proceed.\nCustom Kernel on Ubuntu / Debian / Mint / Pop OS Official Site https://liquorix.net/ for the Liquorix Kernel.\nVanilla Debian requires a bit of a long command to install the custom kernel, but works fine.\ncodename=\u0026quot;$(find /etc/apt -type f -name '*.list' | xargs grep -E '^deb' | awk '{print $3}' | grep -Eo '^[a-z]+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n1 | grep -Eo '[a-z]+$')\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo -e \u0026quot;deb http://liquorix.net/debian $codename maindeb-src http://liquorix.net/debian $codename main# Mirrors:## Unit193 - France# deb http://mirror.unit193.net/liquorix $codename main# deb-src http://mirror.unit193.net/liquorix $codename main\u0026quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/liquorix.list \u0026amp;\u0026amp; curl https://liquorix.net/linux-liquorix.pub | sudo apt-key add - \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update\nUbuntu, Linux Mint, and Pop OS! are quite a bit shorter for the install.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:damentz/liquorix \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-amd64 linux-headers-liquorix-amd64\nCustom Kernel on Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc. For Arch-based systems the command to run is simplier than all of the above. However, this is BUILDING a kernel and on a low-end system this will take HOURS.\nExample: On my AMD Ryzen 2700 with 16 threads and 8 cores, this took almost 60 minutes!\nyay -S linux-lqx\nNote: This uses yay as the AUR helper. you may need to change this if you use something else like Yaourt, pacaur, trizen, etc.\nFor modifying which Kernel you are going to boot in check out these videos going over modifying GRUB\nCustom Boot (Grub, Rescue, and UKUU) YouTube Videos The following videos will help you if you need to revert your kernel or setup multiple kernels to boot into your Linux installation. This is highly recommended.\nGrub Customizer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7qBJ-H7vw\nGrub Rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7meKJsjqfY\nKernel Upgrade with UKUU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnn_MzosdwA\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

Reliable Fastest  16-32 GB/s connection when directly plugged into PCIe 12 GB/s connection still applies when hot-swapped via SAS connection Full Duplex Higher Bandwidth (Able to process the most at one time)   Expensive (1 TB Residential $300-$400 | 1.2 TB Enterprise $1200)      No real surprises here but having it bullet-pointed makes the comparison very easy. I hope this helps those trying to decide on what to buy and typical performance you can expect from it.\nSATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Performance Winner: NVMe SATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Budget Winner: SATA What about SAS? Well, in enterprise environments you see this very often with pretty much every tiered storage device having it. Most of what is on the market today is a mixture of SAS and NVMe for business. These hybrid drives are crazy expensive but give system administrators the ability to claim some of the speed from NVMe without purchasing entirely new devices. While this may seem trivial when you are talking thousands of dollars, this becomes a budget issue. SAS also has the error checking built into the interface, which in turn, gives greater reliability in theory. Personally, I think the future enterprise devices will have some type of new connector or housing that will make NVMe devices hot-swappable without the 12 GB/s SAS limitation. That said, we aren’t quite there yet, and the prevalence of SAS in enterprise space will continue.\nBy doing this you allow all traffic inbound to this computer, consequently, all outbound traffic is already allowed by default.

With all things considered these values are very conservative and therefore can be used if you are hosting with these specs or greater. In future articles I’ll go through disabling un-needed modules to reduce apache’s footprint, thus allowing you to increase these numbers.\n# prefork MPM # StartServers: number of server processes to start # MinSpareServers: minimum number of server processes which are kept spare # MaxSpareServers: maximum number of server processes which are kept spare # MaxRequestWorkers: maximum number of server processes allowed to start # MaxConnectionsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves StartServers 3 MinSpareServers 5 MaxSpareServers 10 ServerLimit 45 MaxClients 45 MaxRequestWorkers 45 MaxConnectionsPerChild 2000  45 processes x 68 MB per = 3060 MB Free Memory needed for the above configuration\n Comparatively, a microserver with 600-700 MB of ram and shared CPU you will be looking at 1-3 Start/Min/Max Start and Spare servers, and no more than 10 for ServerLimit/MaxClients/MaxRequestWorkers. There are other modifications you need to make in culling down apache modules, therefore you can increase these values further.\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

On the plus side, I do like the new chrome tabs, so the entire update is not all bad. Also, the changes to default to secure sites has been a long time coming. There are many different reasons for this, but the fact is by forcing webmasters to use SSL and get secure is a good thing.

I have already moved all the data off the server and it was ready for decommissioning. Before, I did this I wanted to go ahead and remove all these old partitions and just leave the C: Drive with the Windows installation then rebuild the System Reserved partition as NTFS as an exercise. Many backup programs have issues doing block level images with FAT32 partitions OR you need to do a physical to virtual setup. For me, I wanted to decommission the hardware but be able to spin up this server in a virtual environment if needed.\nDO NOT ATTEMPT THIS IF YOU DON’T HAVE BACKUPS!!!! Step 1: **Delete old partitions and create new ones**   Boot into your partition manager of choice (I used Parted Magic https://partedmagic.com/) – GParted\n  Delete extra partitions including the old FAT32 system partition (These all should be very small between 100 MB and up to 2 GB)\n  Create new NTFS partition with 512 MB of space and label it System Reserved\n  Shutdown\n  Step 2: **Setup Partitions with the correct drive letters**   Launch Windows 10 Install disc / usb\n  Shift+F10 once you see language select to bring up command prompt\n  Launch “DISKPART”\n  select volume with 512MB (ex: select vol 0)\n  assign letter=G: (or any letter that isn’t taken that is NOT C:)\n  exit **OR **If Windows operating system is NOT on C:\n  select volume with windows installation on it\n  assign letter=C:\n  exit\n  example output:\ndiskpart select disk 0 list vol select vol 0 \u0026amp;lt;---500 MB Partition assign letter=G: select vol 1 \u0026amp;lt;--- Large Partition with Windows Install on it assign letter=C: exit Partitions are done – now time to fix problems with the “type” of partition – By forcing all paritions to be NTFS NT60\nbootsect.exe /nt60 all /force\nStep 3: Copy Boot Records, Fix MBR, and Rebuild BCD  Rebuild new system reserved partition with EFI and regular boot files  bcdboot c:\\Windows /s \u0026lt;boot letter of System Reserved Partion\u0026gt;: /f ALL bcdboot c:\\Windows /s G: /f ALL  Now we can finally rebuild the bcd and master boot record like you see in so many online guides You can verify the system is seeing the windows installation by doing a bootrec /scanos and then be running through the rest of the commands to do the rest of the repairs  bootrec /scanos \u0026lt;---Verify it sees the windows install bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot \u0026lt;----Pick the installation will mirror /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd  Reboot and you are done!

You need to do this if you make configuration changes to any docker images. By committing changes to the docker images you can backup and clone them.\nDocker is a very powerful tool you can use to isolate applications, therefore, you won’t have them on a single server. However, some docker images don’t save changes to their container when a restart happens. You will notice that when a reboot or unexpected outage happens all your configuration will be gone since the creation of container. The Ubiquiti Unifi Controller docker image is a good example of this.\nHere are the following commands to commit those changes to a new image sudo docker ps -l\nNote: This shows all your containers you need to copy Container ID for the one you want to commit changes on.\nsudo docker commit CONTAINER_ID_GOES_HERE IMAGENAME:TAG\nExample Syntax: sudo docker commit 520b0f024bf6 unifi:latest-06-21-2018\nNow if you have any issues you can simply create a new container using the image you created above.\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

Most businesses want to move to the “cloud” but have no idea what that means.\nIf you’re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you’re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract. Moving to the cloud is often pitched to businesses using Software-as-a-Service replacing the current system with a web application that runs through your browser. While this is ideal, in most instances it isn’t practical. So you keep paying for a bloated IT infrastructure that is dated, isn’t as reliable, and unable to change with your business needs.\nPerforming a Cloud Migration Leverage Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure to perform a cloud migration. Moving your servers will often end up costing between $100 – $400 per server a month depending on your environment. When you factor in that there is no capital expenditure, maintenance, or power costs this is a far cheaper solution than your current environment. You also gain a SUBSTANTIAL increase in flexibility, performance, and reliability. So why hasn’t everyone transitioned to these services?\nMigration Pains The main issue is getting a cloud migration completed. It’s hard to find businesses, technicians, or engineers that will do the migration. In the end, you should be paying these companies directly.\nPitfalls\n Contracting a company that uses their own hardware and you pay them for substandard service and equipment on a monthly basis. Under-estimating the extended downtime that is required for moving to these services. If you have 30+ servers it will take months for preparation, transfer time, and deployment. Degraded service if you have to work in a hybrid environment. Working through a VPN for an extended time that it takes to complete the full migration. Mass Storage – Most of the cost of using these services come from storage, and typically it’s not till you hit the petabytes that you’d run into ROI issues. As a general rule of thumb, anything less than 1000 Terabytes is more cost-effective using these services.  Conclusion I think every business should be leveraging this technology. The larger the business the harder the cloud migration will be. Small businesses I’ve done in the course of a day, whereas larger businesses take considerably longer. Stay the course and keep searching for talent capable of helping with this transition. I enjoy using all three of these major players in the market, however, for Website Hosting and Linux boxes I like Google Cloud Compute the most, and for businesses already running Office 365 Microsoft Azure makes for the easiest transition.\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.

However, recently I tried the windows software raid on a home theater PC. We recently had a power issue and caused the RAID 1 to go into resyncing status. Since it was about 2 TB of data, the resync would take several days and be causing performance issues. I found I could not break the raid or remove the mirror.\nThe following solutions are how you’d fix the issue:\nSolution One:  Open up Disk management (Start -\u0026gt; Run -\u0026gt; Type diskmgmt.msc) Right click disk to remove from Raid and select Offline (Click on Disk to left not the graphic on right) Reboot PC Open Disk management back up, select disk, and put online. Immediately after, Right click graphic and select remove Mirror.  Solution Two:  Physically unplug one of the disks Open Disk Management Remove Mirror  In closing, this will get rid of your raid and give you the ability to repurpose these disks as you see fit.

Sometimes people lost the disc, re-partitioned their drives, or simply had their hard drive fail. This leads to installing windows from scratch and hunting down all your drivers.\nThat is all changing in Windows 8, they are including a “Refresh” option and a “Remove everything and Re-install Windows” option.\nI’m skeptical on how well this works, but in theory, this could be a great thing for the home user. Windows 8 computers are likely to get infected, just as much as a Windows 7 computer. However, having these options at users fingertips could be a blessing or a curse. Imagine if a virus re-programs these features, wouldn’t that be fun 😉 I guess we will just have to wait and see.\n“Refresh your PC” The Windows refresh PC options remove all user-installed applications from 3rd parties, i.e. Adobe products from a disc, Google Chrome, or anything you installed on the “desktop” portion of windows 8. This pretty much erases all applications on your PC, except those from the windows store. You see where I’m going here, don’t you? Microsoft hopes that end users will purchase EVERYTHING from their store, which it can vet and make sure it doesn’t have viruses. Microsoft will, of course, take a piece of the pie on that purchase and is why Windows 8 will be so cheap. I have mixed emotions on this, but it does make a lot of sense.\n“Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows” This will be nice to have it part of the operating system. It should have been there on past windows, but better late than never. A simple reformats, and reload without the need to hunt down the correct windows disc.\nOverall, I’m happy to see Microsoft taking steps to transition the computer world away from where we have been. There will be bugs, and Windows 8 is a far cry from perfect, but I like its direction. I’m looking forward to the official launch next month.\nTo Learn more about Windows Refresh PC and Restoring custom images go to http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx\nThis details creating a custom refresh image which would include 3rd party applications.

Once you’ve messed around with GPO settings enough, you quickly figure out that you need to create new GPOs for specific programs, events, etc… that are not all in one GPO. This gives you a lot more flexibility and makes it very easy to track down troublesome GPO related issues when done properly.\nNow lets say you create a Power Savings GPO that you want to apply only to computers that meet certain conditions. WMI, Security, and Site Filtering are all too broad for this task, and you want to use Item-Level Targeting. After you create your Group Policy Object you will need to add this setting to the GPO.\nIn Group Policy Management Settings\n-User Configuration -\u0026gt; Preferences -\u0026gt; Control Panel -\u0026gt; Regional Options\n-Right-Click and Select New\n-Navigate to Common Tab\n-Check Item-Level Targeting and Press Targeting…\nFrom here you will be able to select tons of critaria that you want to meet for your GPO. This can be system requirements to install a program, or only select certain Operating Systems. You can also add is not tags that will rule out any computer that meet that criteria. The options are limitless and its very easy to incorporate in your GPO. Personally, I never use the often complicated and time consuming WMI Filters anymore.\nI live stream on Twitch and encourage you to drop in and ask a question.
