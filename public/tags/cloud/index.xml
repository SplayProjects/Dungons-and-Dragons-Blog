      <description>Moving to the Cloud The following article outlines what it takes for a cloud migration to Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure means. Most businesses want to move to the “cloud” but have no idea what that means. If you’re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you’re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract.</description>

      <description>Use the commands below to create swap file on a micro instance with a Linux operating system. This creates a 2GB Swap file to help alleviate low system ram. Consequently, this is great for those using micro instances in the cloud that have under 1 GB of memory.
Commands Run the following from your SSH window
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; sudo chmod 600 /swapfile&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; sudo mkswap /swapfile&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; sudo swapon /swapfile&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; sudo swapon -s</description>
